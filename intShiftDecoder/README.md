Very simple decoder to handle obfuscated .Net obfuscation.  In this example there is a function that performs an integer shift on what are presented as garbage values in something like dnspy.  

To Use:

-  Determine which of the multiple arguments are actually being used for the int shift.
-  Run and complete the prompts, including pasting in the values being shifted.
